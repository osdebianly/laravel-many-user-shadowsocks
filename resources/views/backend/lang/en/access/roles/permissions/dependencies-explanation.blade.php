This section is where you specify that this permission depends on the user having one or more other permissions.<br/>
<br/>
For example: This permission may be <strong>create-user</strong>, but if the user doesn't also have
<strong>view-backend</strong> and
<strong>view-access-management</strong> permissions they will never be able to get to the <strong>Create
    User</strong> screen.
